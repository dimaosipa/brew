      Velo is a drop-in replacement for Homebrew that works with existing formulae.
      
      To get started:
        1. Run 'velo doctor' to check your installation
        2. Try 'velo install wget' to install your first package
        3. Use 'velo --help' to see all available commands
      
      Note: Velo requires Apple Silicon Macs and macOS 12.0 or later.
