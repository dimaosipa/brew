## About Velo

Velo is a high-performance package manager for macOS that provides a drop-in replacement for Homebrew. It's written in Swift and optimized for Apple Silicon Macs.

### Features

- **Fast**: Written in Swift with parallel downloads and async I/O
- **Drop-in Compatible** â€” Works with existing Homebrew formulae
- **Sandboxed** â€” No `sudo`, no system interference; operates entirely in `~/.velo/`
- **Minimalist Footprint** â€” Leaves system directories untouched
- **No Ruby Runtime** â€” Parses .rb formulae without executing them; effectively treats Ruby-based formulae as declarative specs

### Requirements

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Mac

## Usage

After installation, you can use `velo` just like you would use `brew`:

```bash
velo install wget
velo search node
velo update
velo doctor
```
